    "Submit your solutions in teams of 4 students. Unless explicitly agreed otherwise in advance, submissions from teams with more or less members will NOT be graded (i.e., count as failed).\n",

    "You may use the code from the exercises and basic functionalities that are explained in the official documentation of Python packages without citing, __all other sources must be cited__.

    "#### General guidelines:\n",
    "* Make sure that your code is executable, any task for which the code does not directly run on our machine will be graded with 0 points.\n",
    "* If you use packages that are not available on the default or conda-forge channel, list them below. Also add a link to installation instructions. \n",
    "* Ensure that the notebook does not rely on the current notebook or system state!\n",
    "  * Use `Kernel --> Restart & Run All` to see if you are using any definitions, variables etc. that \n",
    "    are not in scope anymore.\n",
    "  * Do not rename any of the datasets you use, and load it from the same directory that your ipynb-notebook is located in, i.e., your working directory.\n",
    "* Make sure you clean up your code before submission, e.g., properly align your code, and delete every line of code that you do not need anymore, even if you may have experimented with it. Minimize usage of global variables. Avoid reusing variable names multiple times!\n",
    "* Ensure your code/notebook terminates in reasonable time.\n",
    "* Feel free to use comments in the code. While we do not require them to get full marks, they may help us in case your code has minor errors.\n",
    "* For questions that require a textual answer, please do not write the answer as a comment in a code cell, but in a Markdown cell below the code. Always remember to provide sufficient justification for all answers.\n",
    "* You may create as many additional cells as you want, just make sure that the solutions to the individual tasks can be found near the corresponding assignment.\n",
    "* If you have any general question regarding the understanding of some task, do not hesitate to post in the forum in Ilias, so we can clear up such questions for all students in the course."
